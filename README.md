collaborative-tools
===================

Collaboration is increasingly important in science, and there are a growing number of tools to aid in collaborative tasks.
However it is not always which tools are best for a particular task and group size.
We develop a set of recommendations on best practices when considering a set of tools for carrying out collaboration.
