##Introduction
As collaborative work becomes increasingly the norm in science it is important to develop simple and effective methods to organize, track, and disseminate information at all stages of the scientific process. 
Using modern communication tools improves record keeping and overall effectiveness of communication and workflow in science collaborations [@Ram2013].
Collaborative tools benefit the larger research community by increasing communication, transparency, and synergism among complementary research programs. 
With the growing array of collaborative tools available on-line, it is unclear which are most appropriate for particular tasks (e.g., brainstorming, analyzing, writing) and scales of collaboration (e.g., colleague, lab, working group, research network). 
Here we describe ways in which modern collaborative tools can benefit your research program and provide a framework for evaluating and choosing an appropriate tool for collaborative work.  
In addition, we recognize a number collaborative tools commonly used in ecology and evolutionary biology research programs.

Collaboration is a growing aspect of modern science as evident by growing author lines and increased funding to interdisciplinary work [cite].
* student - mentor relationship (at minimum)
* group consists of people with diversified skills sets and efforts (not all collaborators have to use all tools in group)
* important to be sure all participants know their role

Collaborative tools can aid every step along the research timeline (i.e., idea, data collection, analysis, communication).
* tools vary in effectiveness for group size, labor division, &  task (period of research timeline)
* tools useful independent of proximity
* software development
 
##Reasonable expectations
* What tasks can the tools improve?
* Key Strengths of open collaboration and communication: 
  * make available broadly, 
  * track changes / revert,
  * measure collaborative input for appropriate credit for ideas and work
  * improves work efficiency
  * reproduce-ability
* some of these tools might be useful for teaching

Question: What activities are these tools useful for?
 
##Helpful evaluation techniques
* cost benefit breakdown 
  * tools can be identified in terms of amt of time to develop skill vs input effort 
  * (e.g., Dropbox/GoogleDrive vs. github)
  * (.doc/track changes vs .txt/version control)
* is the tool intuitive for use and appropriateness?
* Questions for breakout box
 
##Research Timeline
1. Idea
   * wiki
   * brainstorming cloud (stella, prezi, "onezoom",  ether pad, CMAP tools)
2. Data Collection
   * recap data paper
   * emphasize metadata and code annotations
   * tools: wiki for methods, smartphone apps, provenance management, , github for data 
3. Analysis (consider combining with Data Collection)
   * emphasize metadata and code annotations
   * tools: code annotation (python notebook, rstudio, WingIDE git gist), version control (git hub, subversion)
   * comment for GUI users (wiki-like methods)
4. Communication
   * papers
   * tools: mark down (conversion software), bibtex, Medeley, latex, version control
     * git - in review make comments and revisions into "issues"
   * talks - figshare
   * social media

##Conclusions / Moving forward
* Can we identify a gap in collaboration tools for Mozilla Science Lab (SW Carpentry collab)?
